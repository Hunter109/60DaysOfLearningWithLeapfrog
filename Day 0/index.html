                <h3>our client says</h3>

                <p>I have known SD Tech for over 7 years. During that time everyone that had used their services has
                    raved about SD Tech as an IT consulting company for their businesses. I needed a replacement and we
                    have a main office with about 25 users and about 10 remote users in our network. I interviewed and
                    got bids from 3 different It providers. SD Tech was priced very competitively and laid out a
                    detailed plan of what he would do to improve our systems. That included both upgrading some
                    hardware, implementing security changes and procedural changes. We decided to implement about 70% of
                    the plan immediately and phase in the rest over the next 12 months. The install of the hardware and
                    software upgrades took about 2-3 weeks. Everything went smoothly with no down time. The conversion
                    of the remote users to a new software took a bit more time but that was mainly due to older personal
                    equipment and software a few of the remote users were using. What is great about SD Tech is that
                    they work seamlessly with the office and implements the updates without a major disruption of your
                    work flow. Also, SD Tech is willing to work with existing hardware/software and process. When we had
                    the hacking scare recently we had no issues from our IT systems. A testament to the security and
                    firewalls SD Tech set up. But even more impressive, SD Tech, emailed and called us as that was going
                    on to tell us he was checking our system and on top of the security. Peace of mind for an owner.
                    Billing has been seamless with no extra or surprise chargers. I would highly recommend SD Tech as
                    your IT Consulting company.</p>
